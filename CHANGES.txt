1.0
---

Modifications:

	- The short form of the command line option for creating a listing file
		has been changed to "-e", to free up "-l" for specifying libraries.

	- The short option for "version" has been changed to "-V" to avoid
		confusion with "verbose".


0.9.9.1
-------

Modifications:

	- Added --numpy command line option to include numpy header directory
		when using -C.

Bug fixes:

	- Pxd files corresponding to pyx files in packages nested more than
		one level deep were not found.

0.9.9
-----

New features:

	- C++ struct declarations, 'new' operator, and del for C++ delete.
	
	- As well as the 'not None' modifier for extension type arguments, there
		is now 'or None' to explicitly allow passing None. It is planned to make
		'not None' the default in a future version. For now, a warning is issued
		(once per Pyrex run) if you do not specify one or the other.
	
	- Extension types may have a 'nogc' option to suppress GC support.

Modifications:

	- Exceptions caught by an except clause are no longer put into the thread
		state and cannot be retrieved using sys.exc_info(). To access the caught
		exception, it must be bound to a name in the except clause. A third name
		can be supplied to capture the traceback.

	- PyString_InternFromString is now exposed under the name 'cintern' because
		it is not a complete substitute for 'intern' (it can't handle strings
		containing null bytes). [John Arbash Meinel]
	
	- Disabled size check for cimported types because it was generating too
		many false positives in the field.
		
	- Added __fastcall calling convention. Also no longer assuming that an
		unspecified calling convention is the same as __cdecl.
	
	- Operations between signed and unsigned ints of the same size now have
		an unsigned result.
	
	- Py_ssize_t now ranked between long and long long.
	
	- Declaration of __new__ in an extension type is now an error, in
		preparation for introducing new semantics.
	
	- Added size_t type, and made sizeof() return it.

Bug fixes:

	- When casting the result of a function call to a Python type, the
		function could be called twice. [David Martinez]
	
	- __Pyx_GetException was not taking account of the fact that the traceback
		could be NULL.
	
	- sizeof(module.typename) did not work. [Daniele Pianu]


0.9.8.6
-------

Enhancements:

	- Check for gil when calling a function declared 'execpt *' or 'except ?'.
		Acquire gil when reporting unraisable exception.
	
	- Added iter2() function for 2-argument form of iter().

Bug fixes:

	- Compiler crashed if base class of extension type was incompletely
		defined.
	
	- Compiler crash on misspelled method name in property declaration.
		[Stefan Behnel]
	
	- Fixed deprecation warnings in 2.6
	
	- Always preserve explicit type casts for non-Python types.
		[Alexander Belchenko]
	
	- Added workaround for threading initialisation bug in Python 2.3.
		[Lisandro Dalcin]
	
	- Deleting dict item with integer key did not work. [Titus Brown]
	
	- Header files for cimported modules included in wrong order.
		[Stephane Drouard]
	
	- Don't allow a member of a ctypedef struct to reference itself.
		[Tim Wakeham]
	
	- Compiler crash due to attribute reference in compile-time expression.
		[Hoyt Koepke]
	
	- Public extension type attribute with cname didn't work.
		[Mark Ellis]
	
	- Memory leak related to exporting C functions. [Lisandro Dalcin]
	
	- Compiler crash on return outside function. [Kurt Smith]
	
	- Scope problem with extension types declared in pxd. [KS Sreeram]
	
	- Calling a builtin method of a subclass of a builtin class did not work.
	
	- Builtin hash() function had wrong return type. [John Arbash Meinel]


Modifications:

	- Added 'tags' to .hgignore file. [Kirill Smelkov]
	
	- Disallow overriding a builtin method in a subclass of a builtin class.


0.9.8.5
-------

Bug fixes:

	- Function export code was erroneously generated for 'extern' functions
		declared in a .pxd file. [Sebastian Sable]
	
	- The 'api' option was not recognised with 'ctypedef public class'.
		[Lisandro Dalcin]
	
	- MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET is no longer set unless the undocumented -X
		option is being used. Hopefully this will prevent complaints about it
		from distutils. [Martin Field]
	
	- Recognize MS_WINDOWS as well as WIN32. [Alexander Belchenko]
	
	- Hexadecimal compile-time constants did not work. [Devan]

Enhancements:

	- Dependency files (.dep) are only created when compiling with timestamp
		checking or recursion enabled.

Deprecations:

	- The features introducted in 0.9.8 and 0.9.8.1 for cross-forward-declaring
		extension types between .pxd files turn out to be unnecessary, since
		the circular import problems they are aimed at can be avoided using
		ordinary forward delcarations in the .pxd files ahead of any cimports.


0.9.8.4
-------

Bug fixes:

	- Incorrect code generated for Python indexing with an unsigned int.
		[Christopher Williams]


0.9.8.3
-------

Bug fixes:

	- Compiling multiple source files at once should work as advertised
		now.
	
	- Assignment of a nogil function to a non-nogil function pointer
		is now allowed.
	
	- Applying += or -= to a pointer and an integer did not work.
		[Arc Riley]
	
	- Compiling a .pyx file whose name is not a valid module name now
		reports an error instead of generating invalid C code.
		[Robert Bradshaw]
	
	- Integer indexing optimisation now performed only for signed
		index types, to avoid change of semantics with index values
		greater than the maximum positive signed int value. [Robert
		Bradshaw]
	
	- Non-void function declared 'except *' could produce C compiler
		warning about uninitialised variable. [Lisandro Dalcin]


0.9.8.2
-------

Enhancements:

	- A block of external functions can be declared nogil at once.
	
			cdef extern from "somewhere.h" nogil:
				...

Bug fixes:
	
	-	The nogil attribute was not being checked for a match when
		comparing function signatures.
	
	- Improved error message for C method signature mismatch between
		a class and its base class.

Bug workarounds:

	- Multiple source files passed to Main.compile are being compiled
		in separate contexts for the time being until I can sort out a
		problem. You probably won't notice any difference except that
		there will be no speed advantage over compiling them separately.


0.9.8.1
-------

Enhancements:

	- It is no longer necessary to specify the base class of an
		extension type in a forward declaration. Also, if the class is
		defined in a .pxd file, the base class only needs to be specified
		in the .pxd file, not the .pyx file.
		[Arc Riley]
	
	- There's now an even easier way to forward-declare a struct, union
	  or extension type in another module:
	  
	  	from blarg cimport class Foo
	  	
	  This simultaneously cimports the name Foo and forward-declares
	  it as an extension type. As well as 'class', you can also use
	  'struct' or 'union'.

Modifications:

	- Casting a non-Python pointer type to a Python type no longer
		generates an incref, unless one is required for other reasons.
		[Arc Riley]
	
	- More checks added for gil-requiring operations performed without
		holding the gil.


0.9.8
-----

New features:

	* Augmented assignment operators (+=, etc.) are now supported.
	
	* Package directories
	
		Modules in packages no longer need to have dotted names. Instead,
	  a Python-like package directory structure can be used, with
	  package dirs marked by containing an __init__.py or __init__.pyx.
	  
	  Top-level package directories are found by searching the include
	  directories specified by -I options (analogous to PYTHONPATH).
	 
	* Dependency tracking
	
		The Pyrex compiler records information about other source files cimported
		or included, and can automatically compile all the modules a given module
		depends on, with timestamp checking.
	  
	  This is enabled by a -r (recursive) option to the compiler, e.g.
	  
	    pyrexc -r mainmodule.pyx
	  
	  There are also two other new command-line options:
	  
	    -t   Enable timestamp checking. This is implied with -r.
	    
	    -f   Overrides implied -t when using -r and forces all
	         dependent modules to be compiled regardless of timestamps.
	
	* Nogil restrictions relaxed
	
		C functions declared nogil can now have Python objects as arguments.
	  The argument names are read-only inside the function when this is done.
	  
	  Among other things, this allows C methods to be declared nogil (this
	  couldn't be done before because 'self' is always an object argument).
	
	* Circular cimports
	
		There is now a way of forward-declaring a struct, union or extension type
		into another module. This allows two .pxd files to define extension types
	  that refer to each other without running into circular import problems.
	  For example:
	  
	    cimport blarg
	    cdef class blarg.Blarg # Forward declaration
	    
	    cdef class Foo:
	      cdef blarg.Blarg blg


0.9.7.2
-------

	Bug fixes:
	
	- Another integer indexing problem fixed.


0.9.7.1
-------

	Bug fixes:
	
	- The optimisation for indexing using a C int failed when the
		object being indexed was a mapping rather than a sequence.
		[Arc Riley]
	
	Modifications:
	
	- Old integer for-loop syntax is no longer deprecated.


0.9.7
-----

New features:

	- Builtin constants and types are known, and are referenced directly
		with no dictionary lookup.
	
	- Direct calls are made to certain methods of lists and dicts when
		their type is statically known.
	
	- New builtin functions 'typecheck' and 'issubtype' added, providing
		safer type checking than isinstance and issubclass (which can be
		overridden).

Enhancements:

	- Redundant type test eliminated when assigning the result of an
		extension type constructor call to a variable of the same type.
	
	- No tp_traverse and tp_clear functions generated for types
		without Python attributes.
	
	- Safer code generated in tp_clear. [Stefan Behnel]
	
	- Indexing with a C int type generates calls to PySequence_GetItem
		and PySequence_SetItem.
	
	- Integer for-loop syntax streamlined to 'for x < i < y'.

	- Appropriate C code generated for compile-time expressions
	  evaluating to float nan, inf and -inf. [Stefan Behnel]

Bug fixes:

	- Value raised by assert statement now only evaluated if the
		assertion fails. [Stefan Behnel]
	
	- Comparing a value of an enum type with another value of a type
		which is ctypedefed to the same enum type gave a spurious type
		error. [Matt Hammond]
	
	- Comparing an int with a float resulted in the float being cast
		to an int before comparison. [Robin Becker]
	
	- Compiler crashed on an invalid argument to a 'with nogil' statement.
		[Stefan Behnel]
	
	- Incorrect code generated for function with keyword only args
		and no * or ** args. [Stefan Behnel]
	
	- GC type with non-GC base type caused crash due to trying to call
		non-existent base tp_traverse and tp_clear functions. [Stefan Behnel]
	
	- Compile-time IF with no ELSE clause crashed compiler. [Kirk McDonald]
	
	- Values in enum declaration were not being checked for appropriate type.
		[Simon Burton]
	
	- Improved the error message from attempting to declare a struct or
	  union member as a function. [Yong Sun]
	
	- Referring to an undefined name in a compile-time constant crashed
	  the compiler. [Stefan Behnel]


0.9.6.4
-------

Bug fixes:

	- Errors in setup.py corrected.
	
	- Incorrect error checking code generated for builtin functions
		and type slots with return type Py_ssize_t. [Robert Bradshaw]
	
	- A counted reference was not kept to the module, so if the entry
		in sys.modules was replaced, the module was freed prematurely.
		[Franck Pommerau]
	
	- A cimport statement inside a function crashed the compiler.
		[Robert Bradshaw]
	
	- __Pyx_ImportModule routine wasn't protected from multiple
		definition when including _api.h files. [Stefan Behnel]
	
	- Temp variables holding exception values were not being set to
		NULL after use in an except clause. [Robert Bradshaw]
	
	- Protect __stdcall and __cdecl from redefinition. [Jim Kleckner]
	
	- A temp var was not being set to NULL after api function import
		code. [Stefan Behnel]
	
	- __Pyx_ImportFunction was incorrectly decrefing a borrowed
		reference. [Stefan Behnel]
	
Enhancements:

	- Functions declared with_gil and external functions declared nogil
		are now allowed to have Python arguments and return types.


0.9.6.3
-------

Enhancements:

	- C API now only uses a single name in the module namespace
		instead of one for each exported C function. [Stefan Behnel]
	
	- Multiple declarations with the same visibility and api options
		can now be grouped into a 'cdef' block.
	
	- The 'api' keyword can now be used on extension types to cause
		generation of an api.h file when there are no exported C functions.
	
	- Added a getattr3() builtin for the three-argument form of getattr.
	
Bug fixes:

	- Setup.py no longer uses an import to get the version number
		being installed, to avoid a problem with setuptools.
	
	- If a struct or union was forward-declared, certain types of error
		message misleadingly referenced the source location of the forward
		declaration rather than the definition.
	
	- Calling convention specifier was being emitted in function
		prototypes but not the corresponding definitions. [Atsuo Ishimoto]
	
	- Added support for the --force option to Pyrex.Distutils.
		[Alexander Belchenko]
	
	- Compile-time "==" operator did not work. [Simon King]

	- Header files generated for public and api declarations now
		only contain types declared as 'public', instead of all types
		defined in the module. [Stefan Behnel]


0.9.6.2
-------

Bug fixes:

	- Corrected a problem with declaration ordering in generated C
		code involving forward-declared struct, union or extension types.

	- New distutils extension: Only compile .pyx if it is newer
		than the corresponding .c file.


0.9.6.1
-------

Bug fixes:

	- Changed os.uname to platform.uname for portability.
		[Alexander Belchenko]
	
	- Fixed C compiler warning about incompatible types in 2.5.
		[Alexander Belchenko]
	
	- Also fixed a few other 2.5 problems.

	- Fixed problem with the Extension class in the new Pyrex.Distutils
		module.


0.9.6
-----

New Features:

	- Top-level C functions defined in one module can now be used in
		another via cimport, and a C API can be produced to allow them
		to be used from C code without linking to the extension module.
		See "Interfacing with External C Code" and "Sharing Declarations
		between Pyrex Modules" in the Language Overview. [Stefan Behnel]
	
	- Facilities added for releasing the GIL around a section of code
		and acquiring it on entry to a C function. See "Acquiring and
		Releasing the GIL under "Interfacing with External C Code" in
		the Language Overview. [Ulisses Furquim, Stefan Behnel]
	
	- Some conditional compilation facilities have been added. See
		"Conditional Compilation" under "Language Basics" in the
		Language Overview. [Sam Rushing]

Language Changes:

	- The __new__ special method of extension types is being renamed
		to "__cinit__". For now, you will get a warning whenever you
		declare a __new__ method for an extension type, and it will
		automatically be renamed to __cinit__ for you. In the next
		release, the warning will become an error and no renaming will
		occur. In some later release, the __new__ method may be
		re-introduced with different semantics. It is recommended that
		you begin updating your sources now to use __cinit__.
	
	- A 'raise' statement with no arguments (i.e. to re-raise the
		last exception caught) is now required to be lexically within
		the 'except' clause which caught the exception. This change was
		necessary to efficiently support preserving the exception if an
		intervening call raises and catches a different exception.
	
	- The following new reserved words have been added:
	
			with, DEF, IF, ELIF, ELSE

Enhancements:

	- Calls to many of the builtin functions are now compiled as
		direct calls to Python/C API routines.

	-	A C type explicitly declared as 'signed' is represented as
		such in the generated code, to acommodate platforms where
		'char' is unsigned by default. [Francesc Altet]
	
	- Python function can now have an argument of type "unsigned
		char". [Alexander Belchenko]
	
	- A new Pyrex.Distutils implementation has been added, which
		exports an Extension type supporting the following options:
		
			pyrex_include_dirs - list of dirs to search for Pyrex header files
			pyrex_create_listing_file - bool - write errs to listing file
			pyrex_cplus - bool - generate C++ code
			pyrex_c_in_temp - bool - put generated C files in temp dir
			pyrex_gen_pxi - bool - generate .pxi file for public declarations
		
		[Contributed by Billie G. Allie]
	
	- Assert statements can be compiled out by arranging for
		PYREX_WITHOUT_ASSERTIONS to be #defined at C compilation time.
		[Contributed by Stefan Behnel]
	
	- Support for __index__ slot added to extension types.
		[William Stein]
	
	- Exception types now properly checked according to pre or post
		2.5 rules as appropriate.
	
	- Py_ssize_t support added. [Stefan Behnel]
	
	- Windows __stdcall and __cdecl qualifiers now supported.
		[Suggested by Eric Devolder]
	
	- Keyword-only argument support added. [Suggested by Stefan Behnel]
	
	- An 'include' statement can now appear anywhere that another kind
		of statement or declaration can appear, instead of being restricted
		to the top level. [Caio Marcelo]
	
	- Unnecessary PyErr_Occurred() call to check result of
		PyString_AsString() no longer made.
	
	- Complicated C types are displayed more readably in error messages.

Modifications:

	- A Python function argument declared as "char" or "unsigned
		char" now expects a Python integer rather than a string of
		length 1, for consistency with the way automatic conversions
		are done elsewhere.
	
	- Support for string and tuple exceptions dropped.

Bug fixes:

	- If an external ctypedef type was used as the type of an
		argument to a Python function, a declaration was generated
		using the underlying type rather than the typedef name.
		[Francesc Altet]
	
	- Some problems with int/enum and pointer/array compatibility
		fixed. [Eric Huss, Stefan Behnel, Jiba]
	
	- Eliminated C compiler warning when comparing an extension
		type reference to None using 'is' or 'is not'
	
	- Eliminated C compiler warnings about docstrings of C functions
		and special methods being unused. [Francesc Altet]
	
	- When compiling with -O, raising an exception in a C function
		that couldn't propagate exceptions produced a compiler
		warning about the return value possibly being uninitialised.
	
	- Fixed warning about function declaration not being a prototype
		caused by C method table initialisation code.
	
	- Spurious initialisation was generated for unused local variable.
		[Helmut Jarausch]
	
	- Declaration of a non-extern C function without definition
		was not detected. [Lenard Lindstrom]
	
	- Applying ** directly to two C int types is now disallowed due
		to ambiguity (it's not clear whether to use C pow() or convert
		to Python ints). [Didier Deshommes]

	- Traverse and clear code was being inadvertently generated for
		the __weakref__ slot of a weakly-referenceable extension type.
		[Peter Johnson]
	
	- Statements other than def inside a property declaration were
		crashing the compiler. [Sven Berkvens]
	
	- Defining an extension type with different visibility from its
		declaration in a .pxd file crashed the compiler.
		[Alex Coventry]
	
	- Instantiating an exception type whose base class __new__ method
		raises an exception caused a segfault. [Gustavo Sverzut Barbieri]
	
	- The 'import pkg.module as name' form of import statement did not
		work correctly. [Dan]
	
	- Fixed error-checking typo in __Pyx_GetStarArgs(). [Eric Huss]
	
	- Trailing comma now allowed on argument list. [Jim Kleckner]
	
	- Behaviour of reraise made to match Python more closely. 
		[Eric Huss]
	
	- An empty C variable declaration crashed the compiler.
	
	- Now includes math.h instead of generating own declaration
		of pow(). [Leif Strand]
	
	- Missing import of sys in LinuxSystem.py added. [Scott Jackson]
	
	- Typecasts using a ctypedef type were not using the ctypedef
		name. [Alexander Belchenko]
	
	- Workaround added to setup.py for a problem with bdist_wininst.
		[Alexander Belchenko]
	
	- Subtle error in parsing empty function declarators corrected.
	
	- Checks added for some type combinations that are illegal in C:
		array of functions, function returning function or array, cast
		to a function.


0.9.5.1a
--------

Bug fixes:

	- Package list now calculated dynamically in setup.py so that
		it will work with or without the testing framework installed.


0.9.5.1
-------

Bug fixes:

	- Comparing two values of the same enum type incorrectly
		produced an error. [Anders Gustafsson]
	
	- Compiler crash caused by assigning a Python value to
		a variable of an enum type. [Peter Johnson]
	
	- Comparison between pointer and array incorrectly produced
		a type mismatch error. [Helmut Jarausch]
	
	- Unused local Python variable had spurious init/cleanup code
		generated for it, causing C compilation errors. [Helmut Jarausch]
	
	- Updated list of packages in setup.py.

Modifications:

	- NULL in Pyrex source now translated into NULL instead of 0
		in C code, to allow for the possibility of calling something
		not defined with a prototype in an external header. [Adapted Cat]


0.9.5
-----

Enhancements:

	- Exception return values may now be specified by arbitrary
		constant expressions of appropriate type, not just literals.
		[Stefan Behnel]
	
	- Redundant type check now omitted when passing a literal None
		to a function expecting an extension type. [Patch by Sam Rushing]
		
	- New-style classes now allowed as exceptions for compatibility
		with Python 2.5 (inheritance from BaseException not currently
		checked). [Stefan Behnel]
	
	- Sequence unpacking is now done using the iterator protocol
		instead of indexing.
	
	- Allocation of an empty tuple is avoided when making a
		Python call with no arguments. [Stefan Behnel]
	
	- Most warnings about unused variables and labels have been
		eliminated.
	
	- Support for running the test suite on Linux added but not
		yet fully tested. [Based in part on patch by Eric Wald].
	
	- Makefile included for compiling the patched Carbon File module
		used by the MacOSX test code.

Modifications:
	
	- Type rules for enums tightened for compatibility with C++.
	
	- Direct assignment from float to int disallowed to prevent
		C++ compilation warnings.
	
	- Hex literals left as hex in C code to avoid warnings from
		the C compiler about decimal constants becoming unsigned.
	
Bug fixes:

	- Exception raised during argument conversion could cause crash
		due to uninitialised local variables. [Konrad Hinsen]
	
	- Assignment to a C attribute of an extension type from a
		different type could generate C code with a pointer type
		mismatch. [Atsuo Ishimoto]
	
	- Backslash in a string literal before a non-special character
		was not handled correctly. [Yuan Mang]
	
	- Temporary vars used by del statement not being properly
		released, sometimes leading to double decrefs. [Jiba]
	
	- A return statement whose expression raises an exception
		inside a try-except that catches the exception could cause
		a crash. [Anders Gustafsson]
	
	- Fixed type compatibility checking problem between pointers
		and arrays. [Lenard Lindstrom]

	- Circular imports between modules defining extension types
		caused unresolvable import order conflicts. [Mike Wyatt]
	
	- Cimporting multiple submodules from the same package caused
		a redefined name error for the top level name. [Martin Albrecht]
	
	- Incorrect reference counting when assigning to an element of an
		array that is a C attribute of an extension type. [Igor Khavkine]
	
	- Weak-referenceable extension types were not implemented
		properly. [Chris Perkins, Peter Johnson]
	
	- Crash if C variable declared readonly outside an extension
		type definition. [Eric Huss]

Doc updates:

	- Expanded discussion of the need for type declarations to enable
		access to attributes of extension types.
	
	- Added a section "Source Files and Compilation" explaining the
		rules for naming of source files of modules residing in packages,
		and instructions for using the compiler and distutils extension.


0.9.4.1
-------

Bug fixes:

	- Fixed indentation problem in Pyrex.Distutils.build_ext.
		[Oliver Grisel]


0.9.4
-----

Improvements:

	- All use of lvalue casts has been eliminated, for
		compatibility with gcc4.
	
	- PyMODINIT_FUNC now used to declare the module init function.
	
	- Generated code should be compilable as either C or C++.
		When compiling as C++, "extern C" is used where appropriate
		to preserve linkage semantics.
	
	- An extension type can be made weak-referenceable by
		giving it a C attribute of type object called __weakref__.
	
	- Source files opened in universal newlines mode.
	
	- Support for public extension type C attributes of type
		long long and unsigned long long added (but not tested).
		[Sam Rushing]
	
	- Distutils include directories now passed to Pyrex compiler.
		[Konrad Hinsen]
	
	- Integer constants with an "L" suffix are now allowed
		and are converted to Python long integers. [Rainer Deyke]
	
	- A broken .c file is no longer left behind if there are
		compilation errors.
	
	- Using the result of a Python indexing or attribute access
		operation as a char * is no longer considered an error in
		most cases, as the former behaviour proved to be more
		annoying than helpful.
	
Bug fixes:

	- Fixed problems with conversion from Python integers to
		C unsigned longs. Now use PyInt_AsUnsignedLongMask and
		PyInt_AsUnsignedLongLongMask instead of the PyLong_*
		functions (which only work on Python longs). [Wim Vree]
	
	- C unsigned ints now converted to/from Python longs intead
		of Python ints to avoid overflow problems. [Heiko Wundram]
	
	- Correct PyArg_ParseTuple format characters now used for
		unsigned types. [Jeff Bowden]
	
	- Nonzero return value from a base class tp_traverse call
		is handled.
	
	- Taking sizeof an incomplete type caused a crash while
		producing an error message. [Drew Perttula]
	
	- If a module cimported itself, definitions of global variables
		were generated twice. [Parzival Herzog]
	
	- Distutils extension updated to handle changed signature of
		swig_sources(). [David M. Cooke]
	
	- Incorrect C code generated for a raw string containing a double
		quote preceded by a backslash. [Thomas Drake]
	
	- Declaration of public C function with an exception value written
		to generated .pxi file without the except clause. [Robby Dermody]
	
	- __delitem__ method of an extension type with no __setitem__
		did not get called. [Richard Boulton]
	
	- A spurious Py_INCREF was generated when a return statement
		required a type test. [Jonathan Doda]
	
	- Casting a value to a function pointer and then immediately
		calling it generated a cast to a function instead of a cast
		to a function pointer. [Simon Burton]
	
	- Py_TPFLAGS_HAVE_GC was not being set on an extension type that
		inherited from an external extension type that used GC but did
		not itself have any PyObject* attributes.
		[Michael Hordijk]
	
	- A return statement inside a for statement leaked a reference
		to the loop's iterator.
		[Jürgen Kartnaller]
	
	- Full module name now appears in __module__ attribute of classes
		and extension types, provided a correct dotted name is used
		for the .pyx file. [Giovanni Bajo]

	- Public extension type with no C attributes produced an
		invalid .pxi file. [Simon Burton]
	
	- Using a dict constructor as the second operand of a boolean
		expression crashed the Pyrex compiler.
		[Stefan Behnel]
	
	- A C declaration list ending with a comma resulted in invalid
		C code being generated. [Alex Coventry]
	
	- A raw string containing two consecutive backslashes produced
		incorrect C code. [Helmut Jarausch]
	
	- An error is reported if you attempt to declare a special
		method of an extension type using 'cdef' instead of 'def'.
		[Sam Rushing]

0.9.3
-----

Enhancements:

	- Types defined with a ctypedef in a 'cdef extern from' block
		are now referred to by the typedef name in generated C code,
		so it is no longer necessary to match the type in the C
		header file exactly.

	- Conversion to/from unsigned long now done with
		PyLong_AsUnsignedLong and PyLong_FromUnsignedLong. [Dug Song]
	
	- A struct, union or enum definition in a 'cdef extern from'
		block may now be left empty (using 'pass'). This can be useful
		if you need to declare a variable of that type, but don't need
		to refer to any of its members.
	
	- More flexible about ordering of qualifiers such as 'long' and
		'unsigned'. ["John (J5) Palmieri"]


Bug fixes:

	- Non-interned string literals used in a Python class
		definition did not work. [Atsuo Ishimoto, Andreas Kostyrka]
	
	- Return types of the buffer interface functions for extension
		types have been corrected. [Dug Song]
	
	- Added 'static' to declarations of string literals. [Phil Frost]
	
	- Float literals are now copied directly to the C code as written,
		to avoid problems with loss of precision. [Mario Pernici]
	
	- Inheriting from an extension type with C methods defined in
		another Pyrex module did not work. [Itamar Shtull-Trauring]

0.9.2.1
-------

Bug fixes:

	- Corrected an import statement setup.py, and made it
		check for a unix platform in a more reliable way.

0.9.2
-----

Enhancements:

	- Names of Python global variables and attributes are now
		interned, and PyObject_GetAttr/SetAttr are used instead
		of PyObject_GetAttrString/SetAttrString. String literals
		which resemble Python identifiers are also interned.
	
	- String literals are now converted to Python objects only
		once instead of every time they are used.
	
	- NUL characters are now allowed in Python string literals.

	- Added some missing error checking code to the beginning
		of module init functions. It's unlikely the operations
		involved would ever fail, but you never know.

Bug fixes:

	- Corrected some problems introduced by moving the Plex
		package.

0.9.1.1
-------

Bug fixes:

	- Corrected a problem in the setup.py (pyrexc script incorrectly
		named).
	
	- Updated the distutils extension to match changes in the
		Pyrex compiler calling interface.
	
	- Doing 'make clean' in Demos/callback was removing a little too
		much (that's why cheesefinder.c kept disappearing).

0.9.1
-----

Enhancements:

	- A C method can now call an inherited C method by the usual
		Python technique. [Jiba]
	
	- The __modname__ of a Python class is now set correctly. [Paul Prescod]
	
	- A MANIFEST.in file has been added to the distribution to
		facilitate building rpms. [contributed by Konrad Hinsen]

Bug fixes:

  - Conditional code now generated to allow for the renaming of LONG_LONG
    to PY_LONG_LONG that occurred between Python 2.2 and 2.3.

	- Header files referenced in cimported modules were not being included.
		[Tom Popovich]
	
	- References to C functions and variables in a cimported module were
		not being recognised if made from within a local scope. [Tom Popovich]
	
	- Spurious declarations in code generated for a "finally" block.
		[Brandon Long]
	
	- Attempting to return a value from a __contains__ method didn't work.
		[Andreas Kostyrka]
	
	- Incorrect code generated for an extension type with C methods
		inheriting from a base type with no C methods. [Robin Becker]
	
	- Failure to report an error if a C method was defined in the
		implementation part of an extension type that was not declared
		in the corresponding definition part. Documentation also updated
		to explain that this is necessary. [Jiba]
	
	- Made it an error to forward-declare an extension type with
		a different base class specification from its subsequent
		definition. [Jiba]
	
	- C attributes of an extension type were not being propagated
		through more than one level of inheritance. [Jiba]
	
	- If a garbage collection occurred early enough in the __new__
		method of an extension type with Python-valued C attributes,
		a crash could occur in its tp_traverse function.
		[reported by Jiba, fix suggested by Paul Prescod]
	
	- An empty vtable struct is no longer generated for extension
		types with no C methods. [Robin Becker]
	
	- Memory was leaked in the sq_item function of an extension
		type with a __getitem__ method. [Atsuo Ishimoto]
	
	- Code generated to work around a bug in some versions of Python
		2.2 which fails to initialise the tp_free slot correctly in
		some circumstances. [Matthias Baas]
	
	- Compiler crash when defining an extension type with a base
		class specified by a dotted name. [Alain Pointdexter]
	
	- Referencing an extension type defined in a cimported module
		at run time did not work correctly. [Alain Pointdexter]
	
	- Incorrect object struct code generated for an extension type
		whose base class was defined in a .pxd file. [Alain Pointdexter]
	
	- Redeclaring a type that wasn't previously an extension type
		as an extension type caused a compiler crash. [Scott Robinson]
	
	- Incorrect code was generated for return statements in a
		special method with no return value. [Gary Bishop]
	
	- Single-line def statement did not work. [Francois Pinard]
	
Modifications:
	
	- Only the last pathname component of the .pyx file is reported in
		backtraces now. [Bryan Weingarten]
	
	- Documentation corrected to remove the erroneous statement that
		extension classes can have a __del__ method. [Bryan Weingarten]
	
	- Note added to documentation explaining that it is not possible
		for an extension type's __new__ method to explicitly call the
		inherited __new__ method.
	
	- The version of Plex included with Pyrex is now installed
		as a subpackage of the Pyrex package, rather than as a
		top-level package, so as not to interfere with any other
		version of Plex the user may have installed.

0.9
---

New features:

	- Extension types can have properties. See the new "Properties"
		section in the "Extension Types" page.
	
	- An extension type can inherit from a builtin type or another
		extension type. See "Subclassing" in the "Extension Types" page.
	
	- Extension types can have C methods, which can be overridden
		in derived extension types. See "C Methods" in the "Extension Types"
		page.

Enhancements:
	
	- Conversion is now performed between C long longs and Python
		long integers without chopping to the size of a C long.
		Also the Python PY_LONG_LONG type is now used for long longs
		for greater portability.

Bug fixes:

	- Names were sometimes being generated that were insufficiently 
		unique in the presence of cimported declarations.
	
	- Changed the way the included filename table is declared from
		char *[] to char **, to stop MSVC from complaining about it
		having an unknown size. [Alexander A Naanou]
	
	- Second argument of assert statement was not being coerced
		to a Python value. [Francois Pinard]
	
	- Return statement without value wasn't accepted in some
		extension type special methods when it should have been.
		[Francois Pinard]

	- Attempting to call a non-function C value crashed the
		compiler. [John J Lee]
	
	- Functions declared as "except *" were not returning exceptions.
		[John J Lee]
		
	- A syntax warning from Plex about assignment to None has
		been eliminated. [Gordon Williams]
	
	- Public function declaration with empty argument list was
		producing (void) in .pxi file. [Michael P. Dubner]
	
	- Incorrect error signalling code was being generated in the
		__hash__ special method of an extension type.
		

0.8.1
-----

Bug fixes:

	- Names of structs, unions and enums in external header
		files were getting mangled when they shouldn't have been.
		[Norman Shelley]
	
	- Modified distutils extension so that it will stop before
		compiling the C file if the Pyrex compiler reports errors.
		[John J Lee]
		

0.8
---

New features:

  - INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: The type object of an external extension
  	type is now imported at run time using the Python import
  	mechanism. To make this possible, an 'extern' extension type
  	declaration must DECLARE THE MODULE from which the extension
  	type originates. See the new version of the "Extension Types"
  	documentation for details.
  	
  	This change was made to eliminate the need for Pyrex to be 
  	told the C name of the type object, or for the Pyrex module 
  	to be linked against the object code providing the type object.
  
  	You will have to update any existing external extension type
  	declarations that you are using. I'm sorry about that, but it
  	was too hard to support both the old and new ways.
  
  - Compile-time importing: A Pyrex module can now import declarations 
  	from another Pyrex module using the new 'cimport' statement. See 
  	the new section on "Sharing Declarations Between Pyrex Modules" in 
  	the documentation.

Minor improvements:

	- An error is reported if you declare a struct, union or
		extension type using 'cdef' in one place and 'ctypedef'
		in another.
	
	- Struct, union and extension types can only be forward-
		declared using 'cdef', not 'ctypedef' (otherwise invalid 
		C code would be generated).
	
	- The 'global' statement can be used at the module level to
		declare that a name is a module-level name rather than a
		builtin. This can be used to access module attributes such
		as __name__ that would otherwise be assumed to be builtins.
		[Pat Maupin]
	
	- The 'assert' statement now accepts a second argument.
		[Francois Pinard]

Bug fixes:

	- When using Python 2.3, "True" or "False" could sometimes
		turn up in generated code instead of "1" or "0". [Adam Hixson]
	
	- Function return value not always converted to or from a
		Python object when it should have been.
	
	- Certain kinds of error in a function call expression
		could crash the compiler. ["Edward C. Jones"]
	
	- Fixed memory leak in functions with * or ** args. [Alexander A Naanou]


0.7.1
-----

Bug fixes:

	- Calling a function declared as returning an extension
		type could crash the compiler.

	- A function call with type errors in the argument list 
		could crash the compiler.
	
	- An 'else' clause on a for-from statement could crash
		the compiler.
	
	- Incorrect casting code was generated when a generic
		object argument of a special method was declared as
		being of an extension type. [Phillip J. Eby]
	
	- A blank line that couldn't be interpreted wholly as
		a valid indentation sequence caused a syntax error.
		In particular, a formfeed character on an otherwise
		blank line wasn't accepted. [Francois Pinard]

	- Parallel assignments were incorrectly optimised.
	
	- A bare tuple constructor with an extra comma at the
		end of a line caused a syntax error.

0.7
---

New features:

	- Attributes of extension types can be exposed to Python
		code, either read/write or read-only.

	- Different internal and external names can be specified
		for C entities.
	
	- None is a compile-time constant, and more efficient code
		is generated to reference it.
	
	- Command line options for specifying directories to
		search for include files.

Enhancements:

	- More efficient code is generated for access to Python
		valued C attributes of extension types.
	
	- Cosmetic code improvement: Less casting back and forth
		between extension types and PyObject * when referencing
		C members of the object struct.
	
	- C arguments and variables declared as an extension type
		can take the value None.
	
	- Form feed characters are accepted as whitespace.
	
	- Function names in tracebacks are qualified with
		module name and class name.

Bug fixes:

	- A sufficiently complex expression in a boolean context
		could cause code to be generated twice for the same 
		subexpression.
	
	- Incorrect casting code was generated when passing an
		extension type to a function expecting a generic Python
		object.
	
	- Executable statements are now disallowed inside a
		cdef class block (previously they silently caused
		crazy C code to be generated).
	
	- Tracebacks should now report the correct filename for
		functions defined in files included with the 'include'
		statement.
	
	- The documentation incorrectly claimed that an extension
		type can't have a __del__ method. In fact, it can, and
		it behaves as expected.


0.6.1
-----

Bug fixes:

	- Fixed broken distutils extension.



0.6
---

New features:

	- Command line options for reporting version number,
		requesting a listing file and specifying the name of
		the generated C file.

	- An 'include' statement allows inclusion of declarations
		from other Pyrex source files.
	
	- If there are any public declarations, a Pyrex include
		file is generated (as well as a .h file) containing 
		declarations for them.
	
	- Extension types can be declared public, so their C
		attributes are visible to other Pyrex and C code.
	
	- Try-except statements can now have an 'else' clause.
		[Francois Pinard]
	
	- Multiple simple statements can be placed on one line
		separated by semicolons.
	
	- A suite consisting of a simple statement list can now
		be placed on the same line after the colon in most
		cases. [Francois Pinard]

	- The automatic coercion of a C string to a C char has
		been removed (it proved to be too error-prone).
		Instead, there is a new form of literal for C
		character constants: c'X'

	- The __get__ special method (used by descriptor objects)
		now allows for the possibility of the 2nd or 3rd
		arguments being NULL. Also the __set__ method has been
		split into two methods, __set__ and __delete__.
		[Phillip J. Eby]
	
Bug fixes:

	- Values unpacked into a non-Python destination variable
		were not being converted before assignment. [Gareth Watts]

	- Hex constants greater than 0x7fffffff caused compiler
		to crash. [Gareth Watts]
	
	- Type slots are no longer statically initialised with
		extern function pointers, to avoid problems with
		some compilers. The hack in the distutils extension
		to work around this by compiling as C++ has been
		disabled. [Phillip J. Eby]
	
	- Fixed several more instances of the error-reporting
		routine being called with arguments in the wrong
		order. Hoping I've *finally* got all of them now...
	
	- Nested for-from loops used the same control variable.
		[Sebastien de Menten]
	
	- Fixed some other error message related bugs. [Francois Pinard]
	
	- Assigning to slice didn't work. [Francois Pinard]
	
	- Temp variables were being declared as extension
		types and then being assigned PyObject *'s. All
		Python temp vars are now declared as PyObject *.
		[Francois Pinard]

0.5
---

Bug fixes:

	- Algorithm for allocating temp variables redesigned
		to fix various errors concerning temp
		variable re-use. [Mark Rowe]

	- Memory leak occured sometimes when an implicit
		type test was applied to the result of an 
		expression. [Christoph Wiedemann]
	
	- __set__ method of extension types had wrong
		signature. [Josh Littlefield]
		
0.4.6
-----

Bug fixes:

	- Indexing multi-dimensional C arrays didn't
		work. [Gary Dietachmayer]


0.4.5
-----

New features:

	- There is now a 'public' declaration for
		making Pyrex-defined variables and functions
		available to external C code. A .h file is
		also generated if there are any public
		declarations.

Enhancements:

	- Defining __len__/__getitem__ methods in an
		extension class fills sq_length/sq_item slots
		as well as mp_length/mp_subscript. [Matthias Baas]
	
	- The Distutils extension now allows .c files
		to be incorporated along with .pyx files.
		[Modification to Distutils extension contributed
		by Darrell Gallion]

Bug fixes:

	- Float literals without a decimal point
		work again now. [Mike Rovner, Peter Lepage]
	
	- Compiler crashed if exception value didn't
		match function return type. [Michael JasonSmith]
	
	- The setup.py file should now install the
		Lexicon.pickle file in the right place.
		[Patch supplied by David M. Cooke]
		
	- Compiler crashed when compiling a C function that
		returned an extension type.
		[David M. Cooke]
	
	- Anonymous enum types did not have C code
		suppressed inside an extern-from block. [Matthew Mueller]


0.4.4
-----

Enhancements:

	- Tracebacks now extend into Pyrex function
		calls and show line numbers in the Pyrex
		source file.

	- Syntax for float literals made more lenient
		(no longer requires digits both before and
		after the point). [Peter Lepage]
	
	- Method calls can be made on string literals
		(e.g. ",".join(x)). [Pedro Rodriguez]

Bug fixes:

	- Incorrect refcount code generated when a
		Python function needing argument type tests
		had local Python variables. [Matthias Baas]
	
	- 'self' parameter of __getitem__ method of
		extension type had wrong implicit type. [Peter Lepage]
	
	- Repaired breakage introduced by trying to
		allow an empty parameter list to be written
		as (void). No longer attempting to allow
		this (too hard to parse correctly). [Peter Lepage]
	
	- Found bug in Plex 1.1.2 which was the *real*
		cause of the two-newlines-in-a-row problem.
		Removed the Opt(Eol)+Str("\n") hacks in
		the scanner which were working around this
		before. [Pedro Rodriguez]
	
	- __call__ special method of extension types
		had wrong signature. [Peter Lepage]


0.4.3
-----

New language features:

	- For-from loop for iterating over integer
		ranges, using pure C loop where possible.

Enhancements:

	- sizeof() can now be applied to types as
		well as variables.
	
	- Improved handling of forward-declared
		extension types.

Bug fixes:

	- Two newlines in a row in a triple quoted
		string caused a parse error on some
		platforms. [Matthias Baas]
	
	- Fixed problem with break and continue in
		the else-clause of a loop.


0.4.2
-----

New language features:

	- C functions can be declared as having an
		exception return value, which is checked
		whenever the function is called. If an
		exception is detected inside a C function
		for which no exception value is declared,
		a warning message is printed and the
		exception is cleared.
	
	- Cascaded assignments (i.e. a = b = c 
		are now supported.
	
	- Anonymous enum declarations are allowed,
		for when you just want to declare constants.
	
	- The C types "long long" and "long double"
		are now understood. Also, "int" is optional
		after "short" or "long".
	
Enhancements:

	- A * argument in a function call can now be
		any sequence, not just a tuple.

	-	A C char* or char[] will be turned into
		a char by taking its first character if
		used in a context where a char is required,
		thus allowing a string literal to be used as 
		a char literal.
	
	- C string * C int or vice versa is now
		interpreted as Python string replication.
	
	- Function arguments are checked for void or
		incomplete type.

Bug fixes:

	- Non-external extension types show up in the
		module dict once more (this got broken in
		0.4.1).
	
	- A spurious decref has been removed from the
		runtime support code for the "import" statement.
		Hopefully this will prevent the crashes some
		people have been experiencing when importing
		builtin modules. [Mathew Yeates]

0.4.1
-----

New language features:

	- "ctypedef struct/union/enum/class" statements
		added, for use in extern-from blocks when a
		header file uses a ctypedef to declare a
		tagless struct, union or enum type.
	
	- "pass" allowed in an extern-from block.
	
	- "cdef extern from *" for when you don't want
	  to specify an include file name.
	
	- Argument names may be omitted in function
	  signatures when they're not needed.
	
	- New reserved word NULL for the null C pointer.

Compiler enhancements:
	
	- Lexicon is now picked in binary format, so
		startup should be much faster on slower
		machines.
	
	- If Pyrex decides to rebuild the lexicon and
		then finds that it can't write a pickle file,
		it now prints a warning and carries on
		instead of crashing.
	
	- Chat about hash codes and lexicon pickling
		now turned off by default except when creating
		a new lexicon (which ought never happen now
		unless you change the scanner).

Bug fixes:

	- Modified the runtime support code for "import"
		statements, hopefully fixing problem with using
		a Pyrex module in conjunction with py2exe.
	
	- DL_EXPORT now used in both the prototype and
	  definition of the module init function.
	
	- Exception state is now saved and restored around
	  calls to an extension type __dealloc__ method,
	  to avoid screwing up if the object is deallocated
	  while an exception is being propagated.
	
	- Making an attribute reference to a method of
	  an extension type caused a compiler crash.
	
	- Doc string in new-style class definition
	  caused a run-time error.
	
	- Insufficient parentheses were put around C type 
	  casts.

	- Constructors for extension types are now read-only
	  C global variables instead of entries in the
	  module dict. This change was needed to prevent
	  Numeric from blowing up due to touching its
	  typeobject before import_numeric() could be called.

0.4
---

New features:

  - "cdef extern from" statement allows inclusion
    of C header files to be specified, solving
    a number of problems including:
      - Clashes between Pyrex and C declarations,
        due to "const" and other reasons
      - Windows-specific features required in
        function declarations
      - Helping deal with types such as "size_t"
      - Helping deal with functions defined as
        macros
  
  - Access to internals of pre-existing extension
    types is now possible by placing an extension
    type declaration inside a "cdef extern from"
    block.

Bug fixes:

  - Error not reported properly when passing
    wrong number of args to certain special
    methods of extension types. [Mitch Chapman]
  
  - Compile-time crash when defining an extension
    type with a __hash__ method.

Minor enhancements:

  - Hashing of the scanner source file made more
    platform-independent, making spurious regeneration 
    of the pickle less likely.


0.3.4
-----

Bug fixes:

  - Runtime crash when using * or ** args in
    a method of an extension type fixed. [Matthew Mueller]
	
	- Compiler crash when using default argument
	  values in a method of a Python class. [Mike Rovner]

Enhancements:

  - Type slots filled with functions from outside
    the extension module are now initialised dynamically,
    which should eliminate at least some of the
    "initialiser is not constant" problems experienced
    on Windows. [Marek Baczek]
  
  - On Windows, __declspec(dllexport) is now used for
    the module init func declaration (or should be --
    I haven't tested this). [Marek Baczek]
  
  - The compiler shouldn't attempt to rewrite the
    Lexicon.pickle file unless the source has been
    changed (hashing is used now instead of comparing
    timestamps). So there should be no problem any more
    with installing Pyrex read-only.

0.3.3
-----

Bug fixes:

* A void * can be assigned from any other
pointer type.
* File names in error messages no longer
quoted (this was apparently confusing some
editors). [Matthew Mueller]

* Reference to a struct member which is an
array is coerced to a pointer. [Matthew Mueller]

* Default argument values did not work
in methods of an extension type. [Matthew Mueller]

* Single or double quote characters in a
triple-quoted string didn't work. [Matthew Mueller]

* Using *args in a function definition
sometimes caused a crash at runtime. [Matthew Mueller]

* A hack is included which tries to make
functions in Python.h which use 'const'
accessible from Pyrex. But it doesn't
work on all platforms. Thinking about a
better solution.


New features:

* Comment containing Pyrex version number
and date/time at top of generated C file. [Matthias Baas]


0.3.2
-----

Bug fixes:

* The & operator works again. [Matthias Baas]

* The & operator had incorrect precedence.

* "SystemError: 'finally' pops bad exception"
under some circumstances when raising an
exception. [Matthias Baas]

* Calling a Python function sometimes leaked
a reference.

* Crash under some circumstances when casting
a Python object reference to a C pointer type.
[Michael JasonSmith]

* Crash when redeclaring a function. [Matthias Baas]

* Crash when using a string constant inside
a Python class definition. [Mike Rovner]

* 2-element slice indexing expressions. [Mike Rovner]

* Crash when encountering mixed tabs and
spaces. [Mike Rovner]

New features:

* A wider variety of constant expressions is
now accepted for enum values, array
dimensions, etc. [Mike Rovner]


0.3.1
-----

New features:

* More special methods for extension types:
__delitem__, __delslice__, __getattr__,
__setattr__, __delattr__

* Module-level variable of a Python object type
declared with 'cdef' is private to the module, and
held in a C variable instead of the module dict.

* External C functions with variable argument lists
can be declared and called.

* Pyrex-defined Python functions can have default
argument values and * and ** arguments, and can be
called with keyword arguments.

* Pointer-to-function types can be declared.

* Pyrex now supports a declaration syntax that
C doesn't! Example:

  cdef (int (*)()) foo() # function returning a function ptr

* There is now a ctypedef statement.

* Extension types can now be forward-declared.

* All permutations of (non-Unicode) string literals 
and escape codes should work now.

* Hex and octal integer literals.

* Imaginary number literals.

* Docstrings are now supported.

Bug fixes:

* Type tests are performed when using a Python object
in a context requiring a particular extension type.

* Module-level variable holding the type object
of an extension type had incorrect type.

0.3
---

New features:

* Extension types! Yay!

0.2.2
-----

Bug fixes:

* Fixed error message generation again after a previous
bug was accidentally re-indroduced.

* Removed the declaration of isspace() from the code
generated for print statement support (it's not needed
and was conflicting with the system-supplied one on
some platforms).

0.2
---

New features:

* Executable statements are now allowed at the
top level of a module.

* Python class definitions are now supported, with
the following limitations:

    - Class definitions are only allowed at the top
      level of a module, not inside a control structure
      or function or another class definition.
    
    - Assigning a Pyrex-defined Python function to a
      class attribute outside of the class definition
      will not create a method (because it's not an 
      interpreted Python function and therefore
      won't trigger the bound-method creation magic).
    
    - The __metaclass__ mechanism and the creation of
      new-style classes is not (yet) supported.

* Casting between Python and non-Python types is
better supported.

Bug fixes:

* Fixed bug preventing for-loops from working.


0.1.1
-----

* I've discovered a flaw in my algorithm for releasing
temp variables. Fixing this properly will require some
extensive reworking; I've put in a hack in the meantime
which should work at the cost of using more temp variables
than are strictly necessary.

* Fixed bug preventing access to builtin names from
working. This should also have fixed the import
statement, but I haven't tested it.

* Fixed some errors in __Pyx_GetExcValue.

* Fixed bug causing boolean expressions to malfunction
sometimes.
